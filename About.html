        Originally from India, I undergraduated with a degree in Chemical Engineering from MNNIT ALLAHABAD which is one of the most presitigious institutions in India. <br/>
        I am currently a second-year full-time MBA candidate with an ambition to lead a profound impact on the business world by applying my passion for business strategy. <br/>
        I am seeking a platform through which I can help global businesses solve complex problems in the operations and strategy domain. <br/>

Before Georgetown, I worked for 5 years in the oil and gas industry in areas of Operations, Internal Strategy, Smart Factories, and Product Management. <br/>Having been involved in the implementation of various projects at the world's largest refining and petrochemical complex, I enhanced my ability to work with diverse, cross-cultural and cross-functional stakeholders.<br/> Through my work and my background in Chemical Engineering, I gained strong analytical and project management skills which helped me in solving issues in Reliance Industries Limited and positively impacting their business. <br/>

At Georgetown, I look to leverage my operations & product management background and collate that with the MBA program to enhance my business acumen.
